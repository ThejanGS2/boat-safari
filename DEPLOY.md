     - `/` - Homepage
     - `/event-detail.html` - Event detail page
     - `/event-listing.html` - Event listing page

## 📝 Notes

- The `vercel.json` file is already configured with proper headers
- No build process is needed - this is a static site
- All files are in the root directory
- Vercel will automatically detect it as a static site

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If you get a 404 error:
1. Make sure `index.html` is in the root directory ✓
2. Check that `vercel.json` is present ✓
3. Verify all CSS, JS, and image files are in their respective folders ✓
4. Redeploy from Vercel Dashboard

### If assets don't load:
1. Check that file paths are relative (not absolute)
2. Verify all files are committed to Git
3. Check browser console for 404 errors
